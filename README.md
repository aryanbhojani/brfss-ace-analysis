Exploratory analysis of BRFSS 2019 survey data examining associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and adult health indicators using a reproducible weighted subsample (Quarto).

This project is an exploratory analysis of the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to examine how **adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)** are associated with adult outcomes such as:

- self-rated general health
- smoking status
- self-reported diagnosis of a depressive disorder

The analysis is implemented as a **Quarto** report and uses a **reproducible weighted subsample** of BRFSS respondents to keep computation lightweight while preserving representativeness.
